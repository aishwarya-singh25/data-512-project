### Basic Overview
Over the last few years, covid has impacted a lot of lives across the globe and a lot of research has already been done to understand the trends and forecast how the infection will spread in future. In this repository I have analysed the covid data about confirmed cases, mask mandate rules and how these rules impacted the infection. The analysis is only dont for Allegheny County,	Pennsylvania in this repository.

## Notebook - <<<<<name>>>>
The notebook is well documented  and is broadly divided into 3 section. The first section involves loading the data and extracting information only for the required county (Allegheny County,	Pennsylvania). The extracted data from the data files is merged to create one dataframe. The second part of this notebook involves performing basic data analysis to understand the trends. Finally a visualization is generated to display how masking mandate were changed over time and how this impacted the confirmed cases and infection. 

## Dependencies and installation
Apart from pre-installed libraries from anaconda, this notebook uses a library called Ruptures. Here is instruction to installation.
